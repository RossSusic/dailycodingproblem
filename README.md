# Daily Coding Problem
C++ (and probably Python) implementations of problems posed by the Daily Coding Problems site

**[Coding Problem #1 - [easy]](https://github.com/RossSusic/dailycodingproblem/blob/master/001/sum2.cpp "Asked by Google - [easy]")**

This problem was recently asked by _Google_.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to ```k```.
For example, given ```[10, 15, 3, 7]``` and ```k = 17```, return true, since ```10 + 7 = 17```.

* [x] Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

**[Coding Problem #2 - [easy]](https://github.com/RossSusic/dailycodingproblem/blob/master/002/uber.cpp "Asked by Uber - [easy]")**

This problem was asked by _Uber_.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
